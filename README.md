this is where we'll have to put our website content (the html, css, js and so on). 


Please do not change the content in the 'index.html' (homepage), and name your subpage indexX(X is the subpage number),
Two tempates sub-pages are below:
https://casagroupproject.github.io/template1/index1.html </br>
https://casagroupproject.github.io/template2/index2.html

You can put your css stuff under the css folder and javascript under the js folder
