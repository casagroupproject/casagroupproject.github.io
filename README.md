# casagroupproject.github.io
this is where we'll have to put our website content (the html, js and so on). I created two tempates already, you can look at them under:

https://casagroupproject.github.io/template1/index.html </br>
https://casagroupproject.github.io/template2/index.html

What's now text is where James and Anthonys content will go. We can later exchange the domain name through another name that doesn't include github
