;) Heyyyyyyy

This is where we'll have to put our website content (the html, css, js and so on). 

The 'index.html' file is our homepage, you can name your subpage html file as indexX(X is the subpage number),
Two tempates sub-pages are below, you can also access them in the city link of london and newyork in the homepage (just for testing):</br>
https://casagroupproject.github.io/template1/index1.html </br>
https://casagroupproject.github.io/template2/index2.html

In terms of font, that's the font we are using: </br>
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata

You can put your css stuff under the css folder and javascript under the js folder </br>
Please do not change the content in 'build','include' and 'src' folder
