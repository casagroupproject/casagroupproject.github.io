The **Encom Globe** is a WebGL-based clone of the globe from the boardroom scene in [Tron: Legacy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/).  If you don't recall that scene, check out [Bradley Munkowitz's excellent writeup](http://work.gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room) about its production for more information.

This version attempts to stay as true to the in-movie original as possible while maintaining a high frame rate on low powered machines and devices.  It is getting *pretty close* to acheiving that goal and mimics most of the details seen on screen, including the loading animations for the globe hexagon particles, the satellites, and the markers.

It written using Three.js, with parts implemented in GLSL.  It is not at all affiliated with Tron, Disney, or the team that created the original movie version.  It is just a tribute.

A [Demo](http://www.robscanlon.com/encom-globe) is available on my website.

### Usage

The Encom Globe was written as part of a [larger project](http://www.robscanlon.com/encom-boardroom) and with a specific use in mind, but it does provide a certain level of flexibility if you would like to use it yourself as an alternative to the popular [WebGL Globe](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe).  The blue markers, orange connected markers, and satellites can be placed wherever and whenever you would like.
